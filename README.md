# FibonacciPrimeThreadRunnables
App that reverses a string using Thread/Runnables, uses AsyncTask to find all prime numbers within a range, and uses a looper to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to 20 iterations. 

1. Use Java Thread/Runnables to reverse a string entered by user and populate a text view with results
2. Use AsyncTask to find all prime numbers between n and m
3. Use a looper to calculate the Fibonacci sequence unto the 20th iteration
4. Polish Cover Letters as much as possible

**This project has multiple text entries, the topmost is for entering a string you would like to see reversed, the next two** **are for the range you would like to find all prime numbers between. Click the Buttons when you would like the respective** **operations to be performed.**
